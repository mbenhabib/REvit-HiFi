# REvit-HiFi

Rhino is an open-source 3D modeling program, and High Fidelity is an open-source virtual world VR platform that allows for the arbitrary import of 3D models (.fbx) and execution of user scripts that affect entities and environments and provides UI hooks.

The result of our efforts is a pipeline that automates export from Rhino into High Fidelity for Architecture, Engineering and Construction teams to review and edit their project (bridge, building, what have you) in a collaborative environment (High Fidelity is multi-user, has voice chat and allows for editing of geometry). They can then export the edited model out of the system back into Rhino.
